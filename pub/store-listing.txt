This app adds Niagara Falls WEGO buses information to MonTransit.

This app provides the buses schedule, as well as real-time estimated arrival times from wegoniagarafalls.com and news from @wegoniagara on Twitter.

WEGO buses serve Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake in Ontario, Canada.

Once this application is installed, the MonTransit app will display buses information (schedule...).

This application only has a temporary icon and no screen: download the MonTransit app (free) in the "More ..." section bellow or by following this Google Play link http://goo.gl/pCk5mV

You can install this application on the SD card but it is not recommended.

The information comes from the GTFS file provided by the Region of Niagara.
